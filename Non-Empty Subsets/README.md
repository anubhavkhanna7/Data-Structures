[Source](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/arrays/1-d/practice-problems/algorithm/minor-4-41918cb8/)

You are given an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Find out the minimum number K such that there exists a non-empty subset of A for which the bitwise OR of all its elements is equal to K.

**Input format**

 - The first line contains an integer T (1 <= T <= 1000) denoting the number of test cases.
 - The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in array A.
 - The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A.

**Output format**

For each test case, print a line containing the minimum possible value of K.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**
