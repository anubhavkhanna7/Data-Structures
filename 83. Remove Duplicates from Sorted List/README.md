[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## Constraints:

 - The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
 - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 - The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
