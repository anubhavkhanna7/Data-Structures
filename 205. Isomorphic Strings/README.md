## Isomorphic Strings
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings)

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

## Constraints:

 - 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 - t.length == s.length
 - s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

## Example 3:
```sh
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
