## Longest Increasing Subsequence
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing 
subsequence.

## Constraints:

 - 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
 - -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4


## Example 1:
```sh
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

## Example 3:
```sh
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```
