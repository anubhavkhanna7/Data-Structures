# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Constraints:

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
 - -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Example 3:
```sh
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```
