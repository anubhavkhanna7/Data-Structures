An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

## Constraints:

 - 1 <= n <= 1690

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
