# K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-in-lexicographical-order/)

Given two integers n and k, return the kth lexicographically smallest integer in the range [1, n].

## Constraints:

 - 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: n = 13, k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
```
