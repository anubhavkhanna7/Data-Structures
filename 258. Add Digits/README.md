# Add Digits
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/)

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.


## Constraints:

 - 0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
```
