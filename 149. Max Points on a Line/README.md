# Max Points on a Line
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line)

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

## Constraints:

 - 1 <= points.length <= 300
 - points[i].length == 2
 - -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4


## Example 1:
```sh
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3
```
