[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

## Constraints:

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^4].
 - 0 <= Node.val <= 10^5

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```
