# Binary Tree Paths
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.
A leaf is a node with no children.

## Constraints:

 - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
 - -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```
