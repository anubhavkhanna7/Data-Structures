# Power of Three
[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3^x.

## Constraints:

 - -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

## Example 1:
```sh
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 3^3
```

## Example 2:
```sh
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3^x = 0.
```

## Example 3:
```sh
Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3^x = (-1).
```
